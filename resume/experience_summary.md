- I work with system owners on remediation timelines
- I track vulnerability remediation progress


## Major Incidents Handled

### Case 001: RDP Brute Force Attack (October 2025)
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Impact:** Compromised service account, attempted lateral movement
- **Response:** Detected in real-time, contained within 15 minutes
- **Outcome:** No data exfiltration, account secured, MFA implemented
- **Documentation:** Full case study in `/cases/Case-001_RDP-BruteForce/`

### Case 002: Phishing with Encoded PowerShell (September 2025)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Impact:** Malicious macro execution, attempted C2 communication
- **Response:** EDR blocked payload, host isolated within 5 minutes
- **Outcome:** Zero data loss, created detection rule now in production
- **Documentation:** `/cases/Case-002_PowerShell-EncodedCommand/`

### Additional Incidents (Jul-Oct 2025)
- **Total incidents handled:** ~380
- **False positive rate:** <5%
- **Average detection time:** <2 minutes
- **Average response time:** 22 minutes
- **Escalation rate:** 12% (to L2/L3)
