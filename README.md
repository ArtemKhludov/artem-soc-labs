## Who I Am

You know what I hate? Watching logs scroll by while attackers move laterally through your network. So I write code to stop them.

I'm Artem Khludov. I came from Russia, landed in LA, and turned manual SOC toil into automated defense pipelines. I don't just watch alerts—I build systems that act on them. Python scripts, n8n workflows, Splunk integration. If it can be automated, I've probably already done it.

Not a security analyst who learned to code. An engineer who specializes in security automation.

## What I Actually Do

### Security Automation Engineer | DevSecOps

**Real talk:** I eliminate the bullshit in SOC operations. Here's how:

- **Built a centralized SOC pipeline** processing 500+ events daily  
  Integrated Splunk for log aggregation. Deployed 10+ Python/n8n workflows for automated anomaly detection.

- **Detection Engineering**  
  Event correlation rules in Splunk SPL detecting lateral movement, privilege escalation, data exfiltration. Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK because that's what pros do.

- **Automated Alerting**  
  Python scripts querying MySQL, pushing alerts to Telegram Bot. Real-time ChatOps. No manual checking.

- **Centralized Logging**  
  Windows Event Logs (4624, 4625, 4672), Linux auditd, application logs—all flowing into Splunk.

- **Custom Dashboards**  
  Notion API for security metrics. Because pretty graphs matter when you're showing impact.

- **Vulnerability Management**  
  Nessus scanning, automated patching via WSUS/apt, access control reviews.

- **API Security**  
  OAuth 2.0 flows, REST API hardening across microservices.

## Vibe Check

I'm not here to sell you "success." I'm here to talk shop with people who get it. If you're dealing with real security problems—not PowerPoint slides—let's talk.

LA chill. Technically sharp. Zero corporate BS.
